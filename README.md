# Linkedin Voyage - Redefining Career Progression

## Problem Statement
Job seekers have diverse and specific career goals, but LinkedIn Learning currently offers only static, one-size-fits-all learning paths. These predefined paths don't account for a user's existing skills, target companies, or the actual requirements of their desired roles.

LinkedIn Voyage solves this by generating a personalized learning roadmap based on a user’s Career Goal, Dream Company, and Resume Skill Gaps — helping them take targeted, efficient steps toward the role they truly want.
