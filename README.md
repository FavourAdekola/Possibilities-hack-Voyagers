# Linkedin Voyage - Redefining Career Progression

## Problem Statement
Job searchers have unique career goals that require tailored and specialized learning to meet, but currently LinkedIn learning doesn't provide a strong way to meet those specialized learning needs. It's currently Career Journey page is hardcoded and doesn't properly match the needs of a role, company, and a user's predefined skills, so Linkedin Voyage takes a user's Career Goal + Dream Company + Gaps predefined in their resume to help prepare them to tailor their learning to meet those requirements.
