# Linkedin Voyage - Redefining Career Progression

## Overview
LinkedIn Voyage is a personalized learning path generator for LinkedIn users with specific career goals and target companies. Unlike static learning journeys, Voyage dynamically builds a graph-based roadmap of skills and courses based on the userâ€™s existing resume and the real skill requirements of their desired role.

## Problem Statement
Job seekers have diverse and specific career goals, but LinkedIn Learning currently offers only static, one-size-fits-all learning paths. These predefined paths don't account for a user's existing skills, target companies, or the actual requirements of their desired roles. Ultimately, it does a poor job of pushing users the resources to go out and achieve their goals.

## Solution 

LinkedIn Voyage solves this by generating a personalized learning roadmap based on a userâ€™s Career Goal, Dream Company, and Resume Skill Gaps â€” helping them take targeted, efficient steps toward the role they truly want. Additionally, it also helps users find the best courses to complete their skill gaps. 

On top of that, LinkedIn Voyage looks to help make LinkedIn learning a more desirable platform. Users on their Voyage will recieve personalized projects to build out in the midst of their journey to help verify their skill acquisition and build a portfolio of work viable for their career goal. At the end of the journey they will be linked to jobs, and recruiters to help them take the next step in their career.
