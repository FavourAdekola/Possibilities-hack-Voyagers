# Linkedin Voyage - Redefining Career Progression

## Overview
LinkedIn Voyage is a personalized learning path generator for LinkedIn users with specific career goals and target companies. Unlike static learning journeys, Voyage dynamically builds a graph-based roadmap of skills and courses based on the userâ€™s existing resume and the real skill requirements of their desired role.

## Problem Statement
Job seekers have diverse and specific career goals, but LinkedIn Learning currently offers only static, one-size-fits-all learning paths. These predefined paths don't account for a user's existing skills, target companies, or the actual requirements of their desired roles.

## Solution 

LinkedIn Voyage solves this by generating a personalized learning roadmap based on a userâ€™s Career Goal, Dream Company, and Resume Skill Gaps â€” helping them take targeted, efficient steps toward the role they truly want.

## Features

LinkedIn Voyage provides:
A node-based visual learning graph
Personalized to a userâ€™s:
âœ… Career Goal
âœ… Target Company
âœ… Parsed Resume Skills
Each node (skill) includes:
ðŸ“˜ Recommended course(s) to complete it
